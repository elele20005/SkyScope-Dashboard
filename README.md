# SkyScope-Dashboard
## User Story
As a traveler, I wamt to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. So, that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Description
External APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in their context, frequently consuming this data via a server.
Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard application that calls the OpenWeather API and renders data in the browser.
The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Render.

## Usage
I will be using 5-day weather forecast API to retrieve weather data for cities.
